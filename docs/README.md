# Documentation map

New here? Start with the [root README](../README.md) for what Otherlight is and
how to run it, then read [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) before you move Browser
code or change a serialized contract.

Each maintained document has one audience and one subject. Generated output, the
ignored historical material under `docs/archive/`, and tool-specific local state
are not part of this set.

The [V7 research architecture decision](adr/2026-10-08-v7-research-platform.md)
records the accepted replacement direction and qualification requirements; it
is not an announcement of an available V7 release.
The [V7 input contract](../contracts/science-v7/README.md) and
[Workspace V2 migration guide](../contracts/workspace-v2/README.md) describe
the implemented persistence and import foundation.

Component setup and interfaces are documented beside the component:

- [Browser](../apps/browser/README.md)
- [Apple application](../apps/apple/README.md)
- [OtherlightCore](../apps/apple/Packages/OtherlightCore/README.md)
- [OtherlightScience](../apps/apple/Packages/OtherlightScience/README.md)
- [Static screenshot tour](../apps/demo/README.md)
- [Python science service](../services/science/README.md)
- contract READMEs under [`contracts/`](../contracts/)
