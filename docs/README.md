# Documentation map

New here? Start with the [root README](../README.md) for what Otherlight is and
how to run it, then read [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) before you move Browser
code or change a serialized contract.

Each maintained document has one audience and one subject. Generated output, the
ignored historical material under `docs/archive/`, and tool-specific local state
are not part of this set.
